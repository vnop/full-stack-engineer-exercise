# Lennd - Full-stack Engineer Exercise

## Instructions

You will be completing two sets of instructions to build out the UI and corresponding API for a "Team Members" page.

## Building out the UI

#### Details
- Use the JPG or Sketch file contained in this repository as your visual guide. If you'd like, you can download a trial of Sketch here: https://www.sketchapp.com/
- You must consume the API endpoint you create in the API instructions (below). For example, you may construct your API to live at: `/api/users`. How you consume the endpoint is up to you.
- You can use static CSS, setup a CSS precompiler + watching, or use inline styling
- You should be able to filter the list by typing into the filter text input
- Clicking on a row should expand it to reveal the user's address -- only one row should be able to be expanded at a time
- You should demonstrate knowledge on how to construct and re-use components
- Use ES6/7
- Add a "loading" indicator for when the users are being fetched

#### Bonus points
- Add a way to add users, edit users, and delete users
- Write tests for your components using a testing library of your choice
- Demonstrate knowledge of pure functions / components

#### For fun / if you want to get crazy (encouraged)
- Find a way to incorporate Redux (We use it heavily)
- Add animation to the expanding rows
- Output some location-relative information using the latitude / longitude returned by the API endpoint for each user
- Use a Gravatar for displaying a user's avatar based on the user's email

## Building out the API

**Goal:** Use an open-source ORM / database wrapper to store and return team members that match the schema below via a new Express.js route:
```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Leanne Graham",
    "username": "Bret",
    "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
    "address": {
      "street": "Kulas Light",
      "suite": "Apt. 556",
      "city": "Gwenborough",
      "zipcode": "92998-3874",
      "geo": {
        "lat": "-37.3159",
        "lng": "81.1496"
      }
    },
    "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
    "website": "hildegard.org",
    "company": {
      "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
      "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
      "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

#### Details
- Add a route to Express.js to handle retrieving and returning users (ex: `/api/users`)
- Use an open-source ORM / database library (ex: Sequelize, Bookshelf, orm2 or any native wrappers) to store and return team members matching the aforementioned schema. You can use any database of your choice (ex: postgres, mongodb, mysql, sqlite).
- Use a method from the libary you choose to peform a query, serialize the results and return via the Express.js route that you create
- Via your UI, consume the endpoint that you create

#### Bonus points
- Write tests for your code using a testing library of your choice
- Demonstrate knowledge of performant indexing
- Utilize multiple tables/models to reference the user's address and company
- Paginate the results being returned through your endpoint
- Provide the proper status code for the operation's result

#### For fun / if you want to get crazy
- Handle filtering results on the service-side (instead of on the client side)
- Add endpoints for handling adding, editing and deleting users

## To submit
- Send Josh (josh@lennd.com) an email with a link to your repository

#### Notes
- The design shows just a sampling of users. Your result may look different.
- For the icons, use FontAwesome (https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/). The CSS has already been included in the project.

```
> $ git clone git@github.com:lennd/full-stack-engineer-exercise.git
> $ cd full-stack-engineer-exercise
> $ npm install
```

#### Step 3 - Create and Run!
Create a mysql database named lenndDB
Run the development server:
```
> $ npm start
```

#### Step 4 - Seed
Seed the database:
```
> $ npm run seed
```

#### Step 5 - View in browser
Open up your browser to http://localhost:5000/ and voila!

#### Notes
